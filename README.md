# -Easy-Obby
A script for the game "Easy Obby" by "@zknx"

Once you join the game at https://www.roblox.com/games/5972698540/Easy-Obby make sure you do not move and that you wait a minute so all objects load.

Then, execute the script once. If you fall out of the map that means you were not placed in the right spot of the spawn. Execute again and if you got to the place where you can give yourself stuff you did it right. From there you can walk over to the blue point for tbe badge.
